# 🧠 HashSet Pattern Cheat Sheet (Trigger Notes)

## 🚨 When to Think of HashSet?

Whenever you see:
- Duplicate / Contains duplicate  
- First repeating element  
- Unique elements  
- Check if element already exists  
- Remove duplicates  
- Pair existence (sometimes)  

👉 Trigger:  
"Have I seen this element before?"

---

## ⚡ Core Idea
- Traverse the array  
- Store elements in HashSet  
- If already present → condition satisfied  

---

## 🔄 Decision Rule

- Only need to check existence  
  → Use HashSet  

- Need count / frequency  
  → Use HashMap  

---

## ⏱ Complexity

- Add → O(1)  
- Contains → O(1)  
- Remove → O(1)  

Overall → O(n)

---

## 🎯 Advantages
- Fast lookup  
- Eliminates need for nested loops  
- Converts O(n²) → O(n)

---

## ⚠️ When NOT to use

- When space is restricted  
- When order matters  
- When sorted output is required  

---

## 🧠 Interview Thinking

Brute Force → O(n²) ❌  
Sorting → O(n log n) ⚖️  
HashSet → O(n) ✅  

---

## 🔥 Key Mindset

"Can I trade space for time using HashSet?"

---

## 📌 Common Problems Using This Pattern

- Contains Duplicate  
- First Repeating Element  
- Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters  
- Two Sum (variation with HashMap)
